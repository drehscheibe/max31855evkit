# Description & Disclaimer

This application reads out all values from a max31855evkit via USB/HID, much like
the MAX31855EVkit.exe does. The latter was *not* disassembled or otherwise reverse
engineered for this, only the USB traffic (via the Linux kernel's usbmon) was
monitored and mimicked. The download and usage conditions for MAX31855EVkit.exe
were not violated.
